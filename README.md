# Gender-neutral names generator

A simple tool for quickly generating gender-neutral names; useful for prototypes, fake user personas, and other mock data. 

*Requires python3*

## Example

```
$ python3 ./main.py 5
Kade Hall
Aspen Sanchez
Shan Collins
Dia Rogers
Reese Bryant
```

## Usage

* Run `python3 ./main.py` to generate 10 names.

* Optionally, provide a number of names to generate `python3 ./main.py 50`.

## Notes

* The first names list was extracted from the very helpful NB wiki: [https://nonbinary.miraheze.org/wiki/Names](https://nonbinary.miraheze.org/wiki/Names)

* The last names list was extracted from "100 Most Popular American Last Names": [https://rong-chang.com/namesdict/100_last_names.htm](https://rong-chang.com/namesdict/100_last_names.htm)
